Hangman Game with JavaScript
Project Overview
This project is a simple Hangman game built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The game allows the user to choose a category ('Fruits', 'Animals', or 'Countries') and then prompts the computer to select a word from the chosen category. The user's task is to guess the word by selecting letters. The user has six attempts to guess the word correctly.

If the user successfully guesses the word, a winning message is displayed; otherwise, a losing message is shown along with the correct solution. Additionally, a 'New Game' button is provided to start a new game.

Summary
This JavaScript project is a word-guessing game implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this two-player game, one player thinks of a secret word, and the other player tries to guess it. The game allows a configurable number of incorrect guesses, with a default of six wrong answers before the game ends. The first player to guess the correct answer thinks of the word for the next game.
